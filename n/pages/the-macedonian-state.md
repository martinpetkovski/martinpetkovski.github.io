# The Case for the Macedonian State

## Why this discussion?

Discussions about the legitimacy of a Macedonian state—and, more specifically, about the relationship between Macedonian and Bulgarian identities—tend to be politically charged and historiographically contentious. I have found that these debates often cycle through the same set of claims, frequently stated with more confidence than care.

What follows is not a specialist monograph. It is closer to an annotated argument: a structured attempt to lay out, in plain language but with some analytical discipline, the reasons I find most persuasive for Macedonian statehood and for a distinct Macedonian national project. I am writing as a Macedonian citizen with an interest in history and politics, not as a trained historian.

Methodologically, I lean on a small set of primary texts and treat them as evidence of political orientation—how actors described their aims, what institutional forms they imagined, and what kinds of sovereignty they sought. The goal is not to litigate every episode in Balkan history, but to highlight a few recurring propositions that can be discussed with reference to accessible documents.

## The Macedonian Republic

My starting point is fairly simple: across different periods and organizations, a persistent strand of Macedonian political imagination gravitates toward republican self-rule—sometimes expressed as autonomy or self-government, and later as a **Republic**—rather than dynastic incorporation into a neighboring monarchy. That matters because, in the Balkans, state projects were often tied to monarchic legitimacy and to the geopolitical interests that came with it.

For context, much of the region’s institutional landscape in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was explicitly monarchical, including regimes headed by foreign dynasties (e.g., a [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_I_of_Bulgaria), a [Bavarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_of_Greece), an [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Emmanuel_III), an [Ottoman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmed_VI), or a [Serbian dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Obrenovi%C4%87)). Against that backdrop, republican language functions as more than constitutional decoration: it signals a particular conception of sovereignty, political membership, and legitimacy.

To ground this claim in texts rather than sentiment, I cite three documents below that are commonly read as programmatic statements of a Macedonian republican horizon.

## The Manifesto of the Krushevo Republic (1903)

> Fellow countrymen and dear neighbours! 

> We, your perennial neighbours, friends and acquaintances from beautiful Krushevo and its pretty villages, regardless of faith, nationality, sex or conviction, not being able to endure any more the tyranny of bloodthirsty murtats who hunger for human flesh, who would like to lead both you and us to slaughter, to reduce both you and us to poverty, and to turn our dear and wealthy land of Macedonia into a wasteland, we have today raised our heads and decided to defend ourselves with rifles in our hands from our and your enemies, and obtain freedom. 

> You know very well that we are not evil and you understand that it is trouble that made us risk our lives, so that we might begin living like human beings or die like heroes! And because since the times of our grandfathers and great-grandfathers we have lived together like brothers of this land, we consider you as our own, and would like it to remain the same forever. We have not raised our rifles against you - it would be shameful for us to do so; we have not raised against the peaceful diligent and honest Turkish people who, like ourselves, earn their living through sweat full of blood - they are our brothers with whom we have always lived and would like to live again; we have not risen to slaughter and plunder, to set fire and steal - we have had enough of countless derebeyis pillaging and plundering our poor and blood-stained Macedonia; we have not risen to convert to Christianity and disgrace your mothers and sisters, wives and daughters; you should know that your property, your lives, your faith and your honour are as dear to us as our own. Alas, we have taken up arms only to protect our property, our lives, our faith and our honour. We are not murtats of our own land that has given birth to us, we are not robbers and plunderers, but revolutionaries sworn to die for justice and freedom; we rebel against tyranny and against slavery; we are fighting and will fight against murtats, against robbers, against oppressors and plunderers, against besmirchers of our honour and our faith and against those who benefit from our sweat and exploit our labour. Do not be afraid of us and of our villages - we shall not harm anyone. Not only do we consider you as our brothers, but we also feel sorry for you as our brothers, since we understand that you are slaves like ourselves, slaves of the Sultan and of his beys, effendis and pashas, slaves of the rich and powerful, slaves of tyrants and oppressors, who have set fire to the empire from all four sides and have made us rise up for justice, for freedom and for human life. We invite you, too, to join us in our struggle for justice, freedom and human life! Come, Moslem brothers, let us together go against your and our enemies! Come under the banner of "Autonomous Macedonia"! Macedonia is the mother of us all and she calls on us for help. Let us break the chains of slavery, free ourselves from suffering and pain, and dry the rivers of blood and tears! Join us, brothers, let us fuse our souls and hearts and save ourselves, so that we and our children and our children's children might live in peace, work calmly and make progress!... 

> Dear neighbours! We understand that you as Turks, Arnauts and Moslems might think that the empire is yours and that you are not slaves since there is no cross on the imperial flag but a star and a crescent. You will soon see and understand that this is not so and that you are wrong. Nevertheless, if you honour does not allow you to join us and declare yourselves against the Sultan's tyranny, we, your brothers in suffering and of the same homeland, shall do you no harm and shall not hate you. We will fight alone both for you and us, and if necessary, we will fight to the last man under the banner for our and your freedom, for our and your justice. "Freedom or Death" is written on our foreheads and on our blood-stained banner. We have already raised that banner and there is no way back. If you consider us as your brothers, too, if you wish us well, if you intend to live with us again as you have lived up to now, and if you are faithful and worthy sons of our mother Macedonia, you could help us in one way at least - and it would be a great help indeed - do not make partners of the enemy, do not raise guns against us and do not oppress the Christian villages! 

> May God bless our holy struggle for justice and freedom! 

> Long live the fighters for freedom and all honest and good Macedonian sons! 

> Hurrah! For "Autonomous Macedonia!" 

## The May Manifesto (1924)

> To the Macedonian people, to the organized revolutionary population in Macedonia and to the Macedonian revolutionaries

> Macedonian brothers!

> Macedonia, within its natural geographical borders between the Mesta River, the Rhodope, Rila and Shar Mountains, the Drim River, Lake Ohrid, the Gramos Mountains, the Bistrica River and the Aegean Sea, with an area of ​​65,000 sq. kilometers, intersected by the Mesta, Struma, Vardar, Drim, Bistrica rivers and endowed with the most diverse natural resources and favorable climatic conditions; with its 2,302,000 population, diverse in its ethnographic composition, with its central economic and strategic position in the Balkans, between the Danube River basins, the Aegean and the Adriatic Seas - has all the conditions and rights for an independent political existence, as an independent state that governs itself, which will serve as a unifying, political and economic link between the peoples and states of the Balkan Peninsula.

> The centuries-old struggles of the Macedonian population against the domination of its territory by one tribe and the tyranny exercised over other tribes inhabiting Macedonia; the resistance it showed against the denationalizing policy of the states that ruled Macedonia or bordered it; the participation of the Macedonian population in all uprisings and revolutionary movements; the cooperation it continuously, in all wars in the Balkans, gave to the countries that emerged to fight in the name of the liberation and self-determination of the Balkan peoples - is the most obvious proof of the rights and consciousness of the Macedonian people to be an independent political unit in the Balkans.

> Starting from and resisting that consciousness, the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization, VMRO, for ten whole years, has been leading the most determined revolutionary struggle for the liberation of Macedonia. This struggle, depending on the ratio of factors in international and Balkan politics and the ethnographic composition of the prevailing organization, set different tactical tasks and used different means.

> For a long time the Macedonian people, believing in the liberating aspirations of the great European powers and the small Balkan states towards Macedonia, had directed their gaze towards them and expected their liberation through their intervention. Accordingly, the VMRO had directed all its activities to raise the voice of the suffering Macedonian slave to the ears of its future liberators, to attract their attention, to provoke their interference, to use the competition of their politics and thus to wrest the freedom of Macedonia. The example of the creation of a free Serbia, Greece, Montenegro and Bulgaria was attractive and encouraging. In accordance with this tactical task of the Macedonian revolutionary struggle were its means, primarily single and partial strikes, either against the ruling authority or against foreign interests related to Macedonia. Even the Ilinden Uprising, the largest and most massive movement, could not count on winning Macedonia's freedom alone, but rather aimed to impose on general European public opinion and international diplomacy the resolution of the Macedonian question.

> There could be no talk of a truly revolutionary action on a large mass Macedonian or Balkan scale, which would count on itself alone for winning Macedonian freedom.

> The results of the European intervention after the Ilinden Uprising, expressed in the hypocritical reforms, aimed more at strengthening and strengthening Turkish rule over Macedonia than at giving birth to its freedom, disappointed the Macedonian people. This disappointment strengthened the current in the ranks of the VMRO, which, counting on the liberation mission of the young Balkan states, directed its efforts to provoke their military intervention. The Balkan War, which ended with the division of Macedonia in Bucharest in 1913, and after it the general European war, with its Paris Treaties that tore apart the living body of Macedonia and divided it among the Balkan states that surrounded it, definitively killed the faith of the Macedonian people in the liberation mission of the interventionist policy of the large European and small Balkan states. The Berlin (1878), the Bucharest (1913) and the Paris Peace Treaties of 1919 convinced even the last doubting Thomas that both the large and small European states were pursuing their own selfish policies, which is why the freedom and existence of Macedonia could only be a coin to be exchanged.

> It follows that from those states, as long as they are led by governments that support the belligerent and imperialist policy of those agreements, or, in other words, until governments are established that will base their foreign and domestic policy on the true self-determination of the peoples, the Macedonian people cannot expect any support for their freedom.

> Assessing this historical experience as a basis, VMRO comes to the conclusion that the final and final conclusion that in its revolutionary struggle for the freedom of Macedonia, it can count only on the extremely progressive-revolutionary movements in Europe, which are fighting against the imperialist policy of their governments, against the existing peace treaties and for the true self-determination of its own and foreign peoples.

> That is why VMRO declares that in the interest of Macedonian freedom it will give all its support only to those who on Balkan soil are fighting against the aggressive policy of European imperialism, carried out either directly or through the governments of the Balkan states.

> However, the governments of the Balkan states do not appear only as tools of European imperialism; they also carry out their own nationalist, aggressive policy. Thanks to that pan-European imperialist and pan-Balkan nationalist policy of conquest, Macedonia, exhausted by five centuries of slavery, devastated by three wars, is today once again enslaved and divided between the three Balkan states: Serbia, Greece and Bulgaria.

> None of the governments of the Balkan states are thinking about the liberation and unification of the still-dismembered parts of Macedonia; none of them are thinking and acting for the self-determination of the Macedonian people in an independent political unit; none of them want to grant the enslaved Macedonians the rights envisaged in the agreements that ensure their cultural development as national minorities. Therefore, the VMRO is forced to declare that the policy of all current Balkan governments is hostile to the free and independent political existence of Macedonia and that it will fight most resolutely and with all the means of the revolutionary struggle against their policy of conquest towards Macedonia and the Macedonian people.

> To avoid any misunderstanding and ambiguity, VMRO also declares that it cannot be disinterested in the internal and foreign policy of the Balkan states and especially of Serbia, Greece and Bulgaria which rule entire parts of the territory and population of Macedonia.

> With regard to Greece, VMRO will fight against any attempt to restore the monarchy - the most blatant expression of ultra-imperialist Greek policy - and against any Greek government which supports the current division of Macedonia, denationalizes the population in Greek Macedonia and forcibly changes its ethnographic composition, expelling the indigenous population and replacing it with Greek immigrants from Asia Minor and Thrace.

> With regard to Yugoslavia, the VMRO will most resolutely fight against all, regardless of party, Belgrade governments that are strengthening the current Serbian policy of violent centralism, denationalization and oppression not only of the Macedonian people, but also of the peoples of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Kosovo, Vojvodina, Slovenia and Dalmatia; all the more so because that policy, supported by some European countries, is aimed at new seizures of foreign territories at the expense of Albania, Bulgarian and Greek Macedonia. The VMRO declares that in the internal national struggles in Yugoslavia it resolutely stands on the side of all oppressed nationalities that will fight against the Belgrade governments - for democratic decentralization and federal reorganization of Yugoslavia.

> Regarding Bulgaria, the VMRO declares that despite all the sacrifices that the Bulgarian people have made and are ready to make for the freedom and independence of Macedonia, the current Bulgarian government of Tsankov, in defiance of the feelings and interests of its people, is pursuing a policy that is openly anti-Macedonian and anti-Bulgarian, a policy that is openly Serbophile, which not only perpetuates the division of Macedonia but also prepares new territorial redrawings in the Balkans at the expense of Macedonia. The VMRO warns the peoples of Macedonia, Yugoslavia, Greece and Thrace that the Belgrade government, relying on its agreements with some European countries for the division of Croatia, Albania and Greece, is preparing to expand its warring policy towards Thessaloniki, forcing the Sofia government towards Kavala, threatening it that otherwise it will occupy the Bulgarian cities of Pernik and Kyustendil.

> The Tsankov government, too, seems to have been seduced by those imperialist perspectives, whispered by the Belgrade sirens. It has set about destroying the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization and the Macedonian revolutionary movement, which appear to be the most serious obstacle to the realization of those criminal intentions. While the Belgrade government is preparing and fanning the civil war in Albania, the Sofia government of Tsankov has set about destroying the VMRO.

> The imprisonment of several Macedonians in Bulgaria, suspected of participation or complicity in the Macedonian liberation movement; the banning of all legal press organs of the Macedonian emigration in Bulgaria, which protect the emancipatory work of Macedonia; the readiness of the Sofia government to reach out even to the most prominent figures of the Macedonian liberation movement in order to imprison them and hand them over to Serbia, apparently as ransoms. The new course of Serbian and Bulgarian aggressive policy, are the latest and most striking evidence of the transgressive policy of the Sofia government.

> The VMRO knows the source of that Serbian and Bulgarian policy. The weakness of the Belgrade government inside the country forces it to sacrifice the interests of the Croatian people in favor of Italy - Rijeka and the Adriatic littoral - and to demand compensation at the expense of Albania, Bulgarian and Greek Macedonia. And the internal weakness of the Sofia government makes it incapable of opposing Belgrade's intimidation and, faced with the danger of the occupation of Pernik and Kyustendil by the Serbs, it is ready to voluntarily cooperate with the Serbian expansionist policy towards Thessaloniki, hoping that it itself will be compensated towards Kavala. In this way, not only the interests of Macedonia and Thrace are sacrificed, but at the same time the interests of Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and all the Balkan peoples are affected.

> The main reason for the weakness of the Sofia government is its isolation, detachment from the masses and the hostility of the latter towards it. Fighting at all costs to keep power in its own hands and finding no support among the people to oppose the Serbian policy of conquest, it struggles, in cooperation with it, to avert the dangers hanging over Bulgaria, inciting the latter to a new adventure, just to achieve some temporary success with which it would strengthen its shaky position inside the country. For this purpose, it sacrifices both the interests of the Macedonian and the interests of the Bulgarian people. It is forced to govern internal politics with terror, suspending all constitutional guarantees; it is forced to suspend freedom of speech, of the press, of assemblies and associations, to dissolve entire cooperative organizations and political parties; it is even forced to deny asylum to political refugees from Macedonia.

> In such a situation, the VMRO declares that the policy of the Tsankov government is hostile to the Macedonian and Bulgarian people and appeals to all Macedonians and Bulgarians to wage the most determined struggle against it.

> They should give their support only to such a government in Bulgaria which, relying on the broad working masses of the city and the countryside, will not need terror and exceptional laws for its governance, will not resort to suspending the essential guarantees for a truly popular and democratic government and which, relying on the trust of the masses of the freedom-loving, democratic and non-chauvinist Bulgarian people, will be able to provide them with the necessary means to fight against the belligerent policy of the neighboring states, without fearing that these means will be turned against it.

> Only in the establishment of such a government in Bulgaria does the VMRO see guarantees for the further successful development of its revolutionary struggle for the freedom and independence of Macedonia and for the political independence of all Balkan peoples.

> Outlining its general attitude towards the state factors of the general European and Balkan policy, the VMRO declares that it is fighting and will fight with all the means of the revolutionary struggle:

> 1. For the liberation and unification of the severed parts of Macedonia into a completely independent and autonomous political unit, within its natural, geographical and ethnographic borders;

> 2. For the democratization of the Balkan states neighboring Macedonia and their union in a Balkan federation, which alone can guarantee the political existence of an independent Macedonia and the independence of the other Balkan peoples; to satisfy the economic and cultural interests of all Balkan peoples, related to the emergence of the three Balkan seas; to paralyze the annexationist aspirations of the Balkans and the imperialist aspirations of the great European states; and also to guarantee the correct resolution of all national disputes, ensuring the cultural development of all ethnic minorities.

> VMRO declares that in its struggle for an independent Macedonia and the Balkan Federation it counts, above all, on the united revolutionary forces of the entire Macedonian population, regardless of religion and nationality, which will lead its struggle in close cooperation with the revolutionary forces of the working masses in the other Balkan states. If, however, the success of its liberation revolutionary struggle depends on the international situation, VMRO counts, above all, on the moral and material support of the progressive-revolutionary movements in the European states, which are fighting against the imperialist policy of their governments, against the created imperialist peace treaties and for the full and true self-determination of the peoples.

> In this way, VMRO finally breaks with the illusions of expecting the freedom of Macedonia and the creation of the Balkan Federation through the intervention of the Balkan chauvinist and European imperialist governments.

> It declares that only those states and governments can claim to be sincere friends of Macedonian freedom and of the Balkan peoples, who with their own policy provide sufficient evidence that they follow and in practice realize the principle of free self-determination of peoples. All others are enemies of Macedonian freedom and against their policy in the Balkans, the VMRO will wage the most determined struggle.

> The VMRO is aware of the relative weakness of its forces, but it also knows well that all of Europe is mined by contradictions much deeper and more irreconcilable than those that caused the general European war in 1914. A new Balkan and general European war or an international civil revolutionary struggle for the liberation and self-determination of peoples is inevitable. What is more, it is already knocking at the gates of all states.

> The VMRO understands very well the great and decisive role that the Balkans played in the outbreak of the general European war of 1914-1918. It draws the attention of all Macedonians and Balkan revolutionaries that in the future struggles that are rapidly approaching, the Balkans can play an even greater and more decisive role, it is enough only for the revolutionary efforts of all oppressed Balkan peoples to be united and united under the banner of Macedonian freedom and independence, under the banner of their own freedom and independence and finally under the banner of the Balkan Federation.

> And therefore, the VMRO appeals to all conscious fighters for the freedom and independence of the Balkan peoples to unite their forces for the rapid formation of a single Macedonian revolutionary front, which will serve to form a single Balkan revolutionary front against all chauvinists, against all annexationists and imperialists, against all oppressors of their own and foreign peoples.

> In order to provide all the evidence that it is directing its activities along that path, VMRO most solemnly declares that it is terminating all persecutions and abolishing all executive measures and orders against individual Macedonian activists, groups, organizations and currents, as soon as they sincerely stand on the basis of the true revolutionary struggle, in the spirit of this manifesto and join hands for a general struggle under the banner of a free and independent Republic of Macedonia, under the banner of the Balkan Federation.

> With this, VMRO takes the first and most decisive step towards creating the necessary favorable atmosphere for convening in the near future a unifying congress of the entire Macedonian revolutionary movement, at which, through the efforts of all sincere Macedonian revolutionaries, a single Macedonian revolutionary front will be created which, relying on the single Balkan revolutionary front, in close cooperation with all progressive revolutionary movements in the Balkans and in Europe, will win the freedom and independence of Macedonia, will impose the creation of the Balkan Federation, will ensure peace in the Balkans - in order to assist in the establishment of peace in all of Europe.

> All forward in the ranks of the revolutionary Macedonian struggle!

> Long live the single Macedonian revolutionary front!

> Long live the single Balkan revolutionary front!

> Long live a united and independent Macedonia!

> Long live the Balkan Federation!

## The ASNOM Manifesto (1944)

> Macedonian people,

> In the days of the greatest world upheavals, in the time of the bloodiest struggle of the Macedonian people, your first National Assembly, raised from the blood and lives of its most ardent sons, in your name comes out before the face of the whole world to tell friends and enemies, allies and occupiers, near and far, that the Macedonian people are determined to live a free life and that no force in the world can stand in their way to full national freedom.

> At the moment when the machine gun fire of our brigades destroys the bloody occupier from Kumanovo and Strumica to Tikvesh and Debar, when our struggle is reaching its highest point and when its successful end has become clear to everyone, the first Macedonian National Assembly comes out with a proclamation for the full national freedom of our people.

> Macedonian people,

> These historical gains that your first National Assembly announces to you are neither accidental nor imaginary. They are the fruit of rivers of spilled blood and piles of bones scattered from one end of Macedonia to the other. During five centuries of slavery, various enslavers plundered your land and enslaved your people. The only means that could not be plundered from you was the struggle. That remained the strongest weapon in your hands and helped you not to be wiped out as a people.

> In the following days of the Ilinden Uprising and the Krusevo Republic, you understood the power of this weapon. The Ilinden Uprising revealed to the whole world how strong your determination is not to be a slave to anyone, but to live as a free people. The Ilinden epic showed you how strong your fist is when it was raised to win freedom. And it was precisely in this way that your strength intimidated your hidden and open enemies - the imperialists from the neighboring Balkan states.

> Scared of this fighting unity, they tried with their poisonous propaganda to divide you in order to more easily enslave you. And, thanks to traitors and defectors in your ranks, you welcomed the decisive year of 1912, divided, bloody, disorganized, and your country was divided between imperialist plunderers. In 1919, the shameful division of Macedonia was repeated, and you did not flinch from the yoke of slavery.

> Macedonian people,

> Harnessed in unprecedented economic slavery, denied as a people, politically disenfranchised, educationally backward, you were reduced to the position of a colonial people during your 23 years of life under Greater Serbian slavery. Serbization became the national slogan of the Belgrade reactionaries, dungeons - their only means of pacification, economic robbery - their economic principle. What sustained you during those difficult years was your struggle against the Great Bulgarian usurpers and their Macedonian scoundrels. In that struggle you saw and matured politically, in it you found your best allies. These were the other enslaved peoples of Yugoslavia. This was also the fraternal Serbian people behind whose name the enslavers from the Belgrade bazaar hid. In the struggle against the Great Serbian usurpers, you forged your brotherhood with the other peoples of Yugoslavia. This brotherhood, in addition to your struggle, became another guarantee for winning freedom.

> Macedonian people,

> With the vile attack of the German-fascist imperialists in 1941, Yugoslavia was overrun, and Macedonia, for the fourth time in 30 years, was divided between Hitler's fascist allies. Under the Great Bulgarian occupation, the most difficult years of the Macedonian people occurred. The plundering took on unprecedented proportions, the Macedonian agricultural economy was completely put at the service of Hitler's Germany. The "directed economic" plunder spread its wings over Macedonia. There was no agricultural product left that could survive the requisition exploitation. The peasants were pushed into the abyss of misery. All other classes sank into misery with them. The entire Macedonian economy was subject to the most shameless plunder at the expense of fascist Germany. The Bulgarian fascist traitors turned into Hitler's most loyal servants. Speculation became an unwritten law. Macedonia was economically exhausted. The Macedonian people sank into unprecedented misery.

> On one side, the old enslaving song was being tirelessly trumpeted that there was no Macedonian people, that we were just Bulgarians, on the other side, the dungeons were being filled with the honest sons of Macedonia, and in the police stations the people's fighters were being tortured with inquisitorial methods. The military courts were working hard, the internments covered entire villages and districts, the best sons of Macedonia were being hanged on the gallows. The bloodthirsty fascist occupier set out for the physical extermination of the Macedonian people. The modern Huns surpassed the most cruel Turkish executioners in bloodthirstiness.

> Macedonian people,

> During the long years of slavery, the harsh reality taught you that you have only one sure weapon against the vile enslavers: struggle. And you manfully grasped this weapon. In the call of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia to struggle, you heard the conscience of your best sons. In its revolutionary spirit felt the rebellious strength of an enslaved people. In its organizational tightness you saw your leader and clever organizer. In its consistency you saw a guarantee that the struggle would be carried to a victorious end - and you did not hesitate to set out with the bold leader and organizer. The revolutionary traditions of Ilinden revived again. The most glorious years in your history are coming, the epic of the sacred people's liberation struggle is coming, in which you were reborn as a people and felt capable of taking your destiny into your own hands. In the unequal struggle, in which you bravely entered, the first in your history National Liberation Army grew out of small partisan detachments, which glorified the Macedonian name throughout the world and became fear and trembling for the fascist occupier. The brilliant victories at Kichevo, Debar, Tushin, Ristovac, Zletovo, Kratovo and Strumica are the glorious history of your army. The liberation of Macedonia is its sacred vow. Inspired by the love for its people, united by the spirit of Delchev, delighted by the fighting spirit of Tito, your army will fulfill that sacred vow and will not let go of its weapons until the last occupying soldier is expelled from our homeland, until the last military representative and traitor receives the deserved punishment and until freedom is completely won and secured.

> Macedonian people, Surprised by your unity, frightened by the bold strikes of your army, the vile fascist occupier understands that he will not be able to hold on to Macedonia alone. According to the old custom of all experimenters, he sought and found vile monsters, ready to sell their own people for the slightest bone thrown to them. The Chkatrovites and Gjuzelovites, the Kitinchevites and Tsipushevites compete to see who can sell you more shamefully. From the espionage service of the fascist occupier, these disgusting traitors have reached the point of organizing gangs, composed of the most criminal Albanian and domestic elements, to fight against our People's Liberation Army, for the bloodthirsty massacre of the peaceful Macedonian population and for the burning of Macedonian villages.

> The frightened fascist occupier has now thrown the last card in the fight against the Macedonian people. The bloodthirsty gang of Vancho Mihajlov, drowned in the innocent blood of so many Macedonian sons, appears again on the treacherous scene, this time headed by the famous fascist agent Aleksandar Stanishev. The professional killers from the streets of Sofia are now making a futile attempt with terrorist nuclei of gamblers and drunkards to hinder the just struggle of the Macedonian people for freedom.

> In the fighting unity of the Macedonian people with the other peoples of Yugoslavia, these vile monsters see the greatest danger to their anti-people plans. - By striking furiously against the Serbian people, they want to strike against the unity of the fraternal peoples in Yugoslavia, to separate the Macedonian people from them, to isolate them in the struggle and, isolated from their allies, to more easily destroy them. With their furious campaign against Marshal Tito, they tried to separate the Macedonian people from the brilliant leader of the People's Liberation Struggle and to bury the freedom of the Macedonian people forever. By throwing lies and disgusting slanders against a new, democratic and federal Yugoslavia, they want to push the Macedonian people into the defeated camp of the fascists and to put them in the dock tomorrow together with the fascist criminals.

> The Greater Serbian hegemonists of Draža Mihajlović and Milan Nedić, unmasked as servants of the occupier and rejected by the Serbian people, despised by the democratic world public, completely defeated in Macedonia, hiding in various German enterprises, are waiting for the moment to throw themselves at the Macedonian people and once again drive them into the yoke of the Belgrade chauvinists.

> In Western Macedonia, Albanian fascists still live around the criminals Džemo and Mefail. Aided by the Čkatrovci and Kocarevci, they burn those Macedonian villages and bloodthirstyly massacre the Macedonian population.

> All these brothers in crime and enemies of the Macedonian people are faithful servants of the same master - the bloodthirsty Hitler. But you quickly discovered the infernal plans of these criminals and gave them a worthy answer. The merciless fight against fascism and the bloody Greater Bulgarian occupier, that was your answer to their attempts to harness you into the yoke of fascist slavery. - The crushing of the contra gangs in their infancy was your response to their attempt to divide the Macedonian people and stifle their struggle. - The indissoluble brotherhood and unity with the other peoples in Yugoslavia was your response to their attempts to isolate you in the struggle. - The building of a new, democratic and federal Yugoslavia headed by Marshal Tito and your unity in the ranks of the People's Liberation Front of Macedonia was your response to all the plans of the Greater Serbian hegemonists and the robber demands of the Greater Albanian fascists. That is your response today to all these enemies - your just struggle for freedom. Tomorrow no force will save these sold souls from the merciless people's court. No force will stop your avenging fist from smashing the heads of these vile monsters and vile enslavers. No force will diminish your magnificent fight for freedom. The fight for your righteous ideals is coming to a victorious end, to full national freedom.

> Macedonian people,

> From the difficult struggles and the spilled blood of the best Macedonian sons, the first National Assembly emerges today, that symbol of your freedom and the expression of your sovereignty, and proclaims before the whole world the full national freedom of the Macedonian people in the FIRST FREE MACEDONIAN STATE. The centuries-old ideal of the Macedonian people is being achieved. For the first time since Samuel, the Macedonian people have created their own state; for the first time, the Macedonian people will feel in Macedonia as if they were in their own home; for the first time it became not a small coin in the accounts of the predatory forces, but a free people in a free state. This is the greatest gain in the history of our people, won in the gigantic anti-fascist front with the blood of the best sons of Macedonia and with the help of the other peoples of Yugoslavia, secured in a new, federative community of the peoples of Yugoslavia.

> Starting from the vital interests of the Macedonian people, from its joint struggles with the other peoples in Yugoslavia against the Greater Serbian hegemony and from the costly sacrifices made against the common fascist occupier, the first Macedonian National Assembly declares in your name that THE MACEDONIAN PEOPLE ENTERS AS A NATIONALLY LIBERATED AND EQUAL MEMBER INTO A NEW, DEMOCRATIC AND FEDERATIVE YUGOSLAVIA, on the principles established at the 2nd session of the Anti-Fascist Council for the People's Liberation of Yugoslavia (AVNOJ), which recognized the rights to national freedom. Thus, the Macedonian people become the builders of a new Yugoslavia, which is the work and expression of the indissoluble unity and brotherhood of all its peoples, and the greatest guarantee both for the freedom of each individual people and for the freedom of all peoples in Yugoslavia together. As part of a new, democratic and federal Yugoslavia, the Macedonian people become an ally of the great victorious powers.

> Starting from the centuries-old ideals of the Macedonian people, the first Macedonian National Assembly proclaims before the whole world its just and unyielding desire FOR THE UNIFICATION OF THE ENTIRE MACEDONIAN PEOPLE on the principles of the right to self-determination. This will put an end to the slavery of the Macedonian people in all its parts and will create conditions for sincere solidarity and peace among the Balkan peoples.

> Being aware that fascism is the greatest enemy of small nations and of Slavism, the first Macedonian National Assembly solemnly declares that the Macedonian people will not lay down their arms until fascism with all its supporters is completely defeated.

> Fighting for the freedom of the Macedonian people, the first Macedonian National Assembly PROCLAIMS THE RIGHTS OF COMPLETE FREEDOM AND EQUALITY OF ALL NATIONALITIES IN MACEDONIA.

> Macedonians, brothers and sisters!

> The First Macedonian National Assembly proclaims these sacred principles at a time when the fraternal victorious Red Army is stepping onto German soil and is irresistibly marching towards Berlin, when our Anglo-American allies in the west have broken through the Atlantic wall of Hitler's European dungeon, when the Allied armies from the south are advancing towards the Alps, when Tito's army, displayed with courage, is preparing to march on Belgrade, Zagreb, Ljubljana, Sarajevo and Skopje.

> The First Macedonian National Assembly proclaims these great principles in accordance with the basic decisions of the Moscow and Tehran Conferences, which guarantee the rights to a free life of every people engaged in the fight against the fascist occupier.

> In these days the fate of our people for centuries is being decided. History has placed you before a fateful test. It depends on you whether Macedonia will be a dungeon for slaves or a free homeland of free people. The sacrifices of your brothers and fighters for the truth call you to a final assault. Your fate and the fate of our homeland call you to a final, decisive battle. Line up all of you in the people's liberation front and prove that you are worthy sons of a heroic people. Rise up all of you against the bloody occupier and prove that you are capable of winning your freedom and building your own fate.

> Macedonians under Bulgaria and Greece,

> The struggle of the entire Macedonian people depends on your participation in the gigantic anti-fascist front. Only by fighting against the vile fascist occupier will you win the right to self-determination and unification of the entire Macedonian people under the auspices of Tito's Yugoslavia, which has become a free community of free and equal peoples. May the struggle of the Macedonian Piedmont inspire you to a bolder struggle against the fascist enslaver! May the path of this part of Macedonia also become your path, for only it leads to the freedom and struggle of the entire Macedonian people! May your participation in the general anti-fascist struggle give life to the principles proclaimed at the first Macedonian National Assembly and may it erase the experiential borders that separated brother from brother, Macedonian from Macedonian.

> Brothers Arnauts, Turks and Vlachs,

> The enslavers of Macedonia have always wanted to divide and quarrel us in order to more easily rule our homeland and plunder our peoples. The difficult past has shown us that the interests of our peoples are the same, and their destiny is common. In these decisive moments, we are all building a free Macedonia. What kind of Macedonia we will build, such will we have.

> Your sons are participating in the Macedonian army and are already taking command positions. Your first fighters are participating as deputies - people's representatives in the National Assembly. The First Macedonian National Assembly proclaimed the freedom and equality of all nationalities in Macedonia. Mobilize all forces to realize its sacred principles as soon as possible. Participate equally in the fight against the occupier so that you can equally participate in the building of a free Macedonia - a free homeland of all nationalities.

> People of Ilinden,

> The bloody fascist occupier is speculating with your sacrifices and your blood. He shamefully distorts the goals of your selfless struggle in the past. He is trying to overthrow your authority, using you as a cover for the terrible robbery and terror carried out against your country. He is insidiously trying in the most decisive moments to divide your people into old and young.

> The goals for which you fought are being fulfilled. Macedonia is moving towards its freedom, towards the unattained ideal for which thousands of your comrades gave their lives in the Ilinden epic. Your first fighter and comrade Dimitar Vlahov is one of our leaders. Your place is next to your sons and grandsons. Forward in the fight for the ideals for which your generation fought, and ours is fulfilling them! Forward, old and young, to build a free Macedonia.

> Macedonian emigration in Bulgaria,

> The slavery of our Macedonian homeland separated you from your homes, from your loved ones, from your villages and cities. The difficult fate of your enslaved homeland threw you into the clutches of the vile Corburg dictator. In the dark conquest plans of the bloody Coburg palace, you were destined to play the role of military provocateurs in the Balkans and a whip in the hands of tyrants against the freedom-loving Bulgarian people.

> We, the sons of fighting Macedonia, have always made distinctions between the murderers of Ivan Mihaylov's gang and the honest Macedonian emigration. We have always known that in your breasts an honest heart of our common homeland has never stopped beating, that our ideals are also your ideals, and that the desire to find yourself again in your free and unalienated Macedonian homeland has never faded. The First Macedonian National Assembly sends you warm fraternal greetings and invites you to a united struggle for the liberation of Macedonia and the building of a free Macedonian state. Throw out the self-appointed leaders around the bloodthirsty Ivan Mihajlov! Join our People's Liberation Front to drive out the fascist enslavers! Take part in the liberation of the common Macedonian homeland! Do your part in its construction! Let our solidarity become a sharp response to all enslaving plans! Let our unity become fear and trembling for the enemies of Macedonia! Let our militant patriotism become a guarantee for a better future for our homeland!

> Macedonian workers!

> You were the first to understand that fascism is your greatest enemy, the most cruel enslaver of your people, and you were the first to enter the holy struggle against it. Behind every victory in this three-year struggle lies the sacrifice of your first fighters. Every success against the bloody fascist occupier has grown from the blood of your comrades.

> In a free Macedonia, in a new Yugoslavia, you will begin a happier and more worthy life for yourself.

> On the eve of freedom, not a single comrade of yours must remain on the sidelines of the struggle. Leave the fascist workshops, factories and mines! Leave the factories in fascist Germany! Join your people's liberation army and become its backbone! With your massive participation, become the pioneers of the People's Liberation Struggle! With your courage, become the pride of our people! With your demonstrated perseverance, build a free Macedonia and become its most devoted creators! Make the new Macedonian state a true, free and just homeland of the entire working people.

> Macedonian peasants,

> You have best experienced on your own skin what fascist slavery means. In these three years, the fruits of your labor have been and are being stolen in the most shameless way, and you are left with only slave labor, poverty, and injustice. The fascist rulers left you to live only so that you could work on their war machine. The occupying plunderers are fattened by your labor, and you remain hungry, naked, and barefoot. Fascism took everything from you, and did not give nothing to you back.

> In these few months, the fate of the Macedonian people is being decided. The fate of Macedonia is the fate of the Macedonian people. The fate of Macedonia is the fate of the Macedonian peasants, because you are its largest part. Do not give your products to the fascist spies! Hide the grain! Destroy the requisition commissions! Burn the fascist municipalities. Do not pay taxes to your oppressors! Enter the ranks of our army boldly! Stand up all as one to win freedom and build a free Macedonia.

> Macedonian young men and women,

> You were the first victim of the fascist occupiers and you were the first to rise up in the fight against them. With your shown courage, you set an example of how to serve the people's ideals. Today, you constitute the most combative core of our army.

> In the struggle that is being waged today, a fiery youth generation is being built. You should build a free Macedonia. With all your might, help implement the decisions of ASNOM and (for) the construction of the new people's democratic government in Macedonia and (of) our Macedonian state.

> Fighters of the People's Liberation Army of Macedonia, partisans, soldiers, officers, non-commissioned officers and political workers,

> With your displayed courage, you have spread the Macedonian name throughout the world. With your unparalleled sacrifice, you have struck fear into the bones of the fascist occupier. With the blood of your best comrades, you have written the glorious history of the Macedonian people. Victory is near, but more efforts are needed to win the freedom of the Macedonian people. In the gigantic struggle that is being waged today, you are not alone. You are part of the glorious People's Liberation Army of Yugoslavia and as such - allies of the victorious Red Army and the Anglo-American armies, which are dealing the final blows to the fascist occupier.

> The burning villages throughout Macedonia call you to revenge! The enslaved Macedonian people are waiting for freedom from you! Hold even tighter to the weapons won with blood, strengthen your discipline and military skill even more! Raise the flag of Gotse Delchev even higher! Prepare for the final blows of the fascist occupier! Prepare for the liberation of Macedonia!

> Macedonian mothers, women and sisters

> In this magnificent struggle you have given your bloody share. In the freedom of the Macedonian people you will also win your own freedom. In tomorrow's free Macedonia, you will be its free and equal builders.

> Participate even more massively in the people's liberation struggle! Mobilize all your comrades for fighting at the front and working in the rear. The fighters at the front need your support. The freedom of your people needs your help. The construction of the new state cannot be imagined without your equal participation. Use all your strength to quickly realize the principles first proclaimed by the first Macedonian National Assembly.

> Macedonian people, brothers and sisters!

## On the Status of the Macedonian Language

The “dialect vs. language” question is often presented as if it can be resolved by a single linguistic litmus test. In practice, the distinction is partly descriptive (phonology, morphology, syntax, mutual intelligibility) and partly sociopolitical (codification, education, media, and the existence of institutions that reproduce a standard). Put differently: linguistics can describe varieties; communities and states decide what is treated as a standard language.

In the context of this essay, the more relevant point is institutional rather than terminological. The documents cited above repeatedly speak in the register of a distinct political community—“Macedonia” as a unit of self-government, and “the Macedonian people” as a bearer of sovereignty. Once a political project is articulated in those terms, the emergence (or consolidation) of a standard language is neither surprising nor exceptional; it is one of the ordinary instruments through which modern political communities administer schooling, law, and public life.

This does not require denying historical and linguistic proximity between neighboring South Slavic varieties. It simply rejects the inference that proximity collapses political and cultural agency into a single, externally owned category.

## On the Claim that the Macedonian Nation Was an “Artificial Yugoslav Creation”

The “artificial creation” thesis usually rests on a chronological trick: it treats the post-1944 institutional consolidation as if it were the first appearance of Macedonian political self-description. The three texts quoted earlier complicate that narrative.

The Krushevo Manifesto (1903) frames Macedonia as a shared homeland and calls for “Autonomous Macedonia,” addressing the population across faith and communal lines. The May Manifesto (1924) explicitly argues for Macedonia’s “independent political existence” and repeatedly invokes “the Macedonian people” as a political subject. The ASNOM Manifesto (1944) then speaks in the idiom of state formation—“the FIRST FREE MACEDONIAN STATE”—and situates that claim within the principle of self-determination.

One can debate how these terms were understood at different moments, and how they interacted with competing national projects. But it is difficult to read these documents honestly and maintain that the Macedonian project begins ex nihilo in Yugoslavia. A more plausible reading is that Yugoslav federal structures provided a decisive institutional vehicle for a political current that already had a recognizable vocabulary and a long-running program.

## On Historical Attribution and the Politics of Heritage

Claims that “there is no such thing as Macedonian—everything is Bulgarian from the region of Macedonia” typically conflate three distinct issues: (1) the self-identification of historical actors in their own time, (2) the later national narratives that seek to claim them, and (3) the modern political dispute about legitimacy.

The documents above show a recurrent political language centered on Macedonia as a unit of autonomy/self-government and, later, as a republican state. That is not an argument that every individual, event, or tradition in the geographic region maps neatly onto a single modern identity. It is an argument that there exists a coherent Macedonian political horizon—an institutional and sovereign project—that cannot be reduced to a regional footnote of a neighboring nation.

If anything, the sensible academic posture here is to treat heritage as historically layered and often shared, while treating political sovereignty as a separate question. In other words: a figure can be embedded in overlapping cultural-linguistic worlds, yet the existence of overlap does not negate the right of a modern community to narrate its own past and to defend its political project.

## On Minority Rights and Civic Equality (Including Citizens Who Identify as Bulgarian)

One reason I foreground the “republican” thread is that it naturally pushes the discussion toward civic membership rather than ethno-dynastic ownership. The Krushevo Manifesto makes a point of addressing “regardless of faith, nationality, sex or conviction” and explicitly speaks to Muslim neighbors as part of the same homeland. The ASNOM Manifesto later “PROCLAIMS THE RIGHTS OF COMPLETE FREEDOM AND EQUALITY OF ALL NATIONALITIES IN MACEDONIA.”

Taken seriously, those are not decorative lines; they indicate an intended political architecture: a state that claims legitimacy by appealing to a plural population, not by insisting on a single exclusive ethnoreligious pedigree. That is precisely the normative framework within which minority rights should be discussed—via equality before the law, protections against discrimination, and channels for cultural expression—rather than as a bargaining chip in interstate historical disputes.

## On Anti-Bulgarian Rhetoric, Policy, and Category Errors

This debate is often clouded by a basic category error: confusing critique of a state policy (or of historical regimes) with hostility toward a people as such. The May Manifesto, for example, sharply criticizes the governments of the region—including Bulgaria’s government of the period—while framing its argument in terms of political programs, strategic interests, and state actions. The ASNOM Manifesto, likewise, uses the language of wartime occupation and collaboration; it is a polemical wartime text, and it targets political-military structures and actors.

None of this settles contemporary questions about public rhetoric, media framing, or the treatment of self-identified Bulgarians inside Macedonia. Those should be assessed in their own right: by looking at laws, institutions, enforcement, and everyday practice. But the existence of political disagreement—and even of historically grounded resentment—does not, by itself, amount to a coherent doctrine of anti-Bulgarian policy. In a republican framework, the standard worth defending is simple: the state should be capable of disputing history and geopolitics without turning civic equality into collateral damage.

## On Romantic National Narratives and the “Macedonia as Bulgarian History” Thesis

The claim that Macedonia is “the romantic part” of Bulgarian history is revealing precisely because it is literary rather than analytic. Many national narratives develop a romantic geography: a frontier landscape where heroism, sacrifice, and “authentic” national feeling are staged more intensely than in the administrative center. In that sense, Macedonia can function in Bulgarian historical imagination as a symbolic reservoir—of uprisings, songs, martyrs, and revolutionary virtue.

But a romantic attachment is not the same thing as political title. One can feel that a region is central to one’s national story and still be making a category mistake when one turns sentiment into sovereignty. This is where returning to primary texts is useful. The Krushevo Manifesto (1903) frames “Autonomous Macedonia” and addresses the population across communal lines as a shared homeland. The May Manifesto (1924) argues explicitly for Macedonia’s “independent political existence” and repeatedly invokes “the Macedonian people” as a political subject. The ASNOM Manifesto (1944) speaks in the idiom of state formation—“the FIRST FREE MACEDONIAN STATE”—and grounds its claims in self-determination and civic equality.

There is also a second, less sentimental reason the “romantic Macedonia” trope matters: it can obscure how thin Bulgaria’s own republican tradition was for much of the modern period. The Bulgarian state was built and governed as a monarchy for decades, and its public legitimacy was repeatedly anchored in dynastic institutions and great-power alignment rather than in an internally articulated republican program. In that setting, it is not surprising that some of the most explicitly republican language in the region’s revolutionary politics appears not in Sofia’s state-building narrative, but in texts oriented toward Macedonian self-government (autonomy, a republic, popular sovereignty).

On the level of geopolitics, the pattern is also instructive. Bulgaria did not “lose every war” in a literal sense, but in the wars that most decisively structured Balkan borders and international legitimacy—especially the Second Balkan War and the two World Wars—the Bulgarian state often pursued revisionist aims through alliances that ultimately placed it on the losing side of the settlement. The result was a recurring cycle: territorial aspiration followed by strategic overreach, defeat, and diplomatic marginalization.

If one accepts that diagnosis, then the claim “without Macedonia Bulgaria has no dignified history” should be reformulated more precisely: without the Macedonian republican horizon, Bulgarian national narrative leans heavily on monarchy, irredentism, and a sequence of state projects that repeatedly misread the balance of power. By contrast, the Macedonian texts cited above are notable for insisting on political form—autonomy, republic, civic equality—as the basis of legitimacy, even when that insistence ran against what neighboring governments preferred.

Taken together, these documents point to a political horizon oriented toward self-government in Macedonia, not toward the incorporation of Macedonia as a romantic province of someone else’s national teleology. This does not foreclose shared cultural memory or overlapping biographies; it simply insists that historical affect and historical rights operate on different planes. If the discussion is about legitimacy, the relevant evidence is institutional and programmatic—what kind of polity was being argued for, in whose name, and with what conception of sovereignty.

## Conclusion

None of the claims in this essay require a heroic myth of national purity. They require something more modest and, in my view, more persuasive: a sober look at what political actors in and about Macedonia repeatedly said they were trying to build.

Across the three texts cited here, a recognizable thread emerges. The Krushevo Manifesto speaks the language of a shared homeland and calls for “Autonomous Macedonia” while addressing neighbors across communal lines. The May Manifesto is explicit about “independent political existence” and treats “the Macedonian people” as a political subject in its own right. The ASNOM Manifesto then consolidates that horizon in the idiom of modern statehood—sovereignty, self-determination, and civic equality.

From that vantage point, several contemporary disputes look less mysterious. Language debates are not solved by slogans; they sit at the intersection of linguistic proximity and institutional standardization. Arguments about “artificial creation” tend to collapse the difference between institutional consolidation and political origin. Claims of exclusive ownership over people and events often confuse cultural overlap with political entitlement. And discussions of minority rights are strongest when they are conducted within a republican framework—equality before the law and civic membership—rather than as instruments of interstate leverage.

If there is a single point worth carrying forward, it is this: legitimacy is ultimately an institutional question. It turns on what kind of polity is being argued for, in whose name, and with what conception of sovereignty. On that measure, the Macedonian republican horizon is not an afterthought or a borrowed costume; it is one of the most consistent features of the political language that the documents themselves put on the record.
