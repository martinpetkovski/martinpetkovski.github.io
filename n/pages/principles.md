# Principles

# Introduction

This document is my personal code — a set of fundamental principles and values that I use as a guide when making decisions and taking actions in life. These principles determine the purpose and meaning of my existence, enabling me to live rationally, freely, and in accordance with my highest values. They are not dogmas, but rationally chosen directions based on reason, individual freedom, and respect for the rights of every individual.

## Morality

Man is the only being whose main tool for survival is reason. Reason enables man to distinguish what is good for him from what is harmful, to set goals and to act to achieve them. **A moral man is one who makes decisions and takes actions in accordance with his rational self-interest**, because that is the highest good — not only for him, but also for those around him, when their rights are respected. Self-interest does not mean selfishness to the detriment of others, but a rational striving for one's own good through effort, creativity, and cooperation.

## Rights

Individual rights are the foundation of a free society and the only way to enable a moral and fulfilled life. They are not privileges granted by the state or society, but natural and inalienable, stemming from the very nature of man as a rational and autonomous being. My principles on rights are as follows:

- **Right to Life**
- **Right to Liberty**
- **Right to Property**
- **Right to the Pursuit of Happiness**

## Ethics in Daily Life

### What does it mean to be moral?

To be moral, according to the principles of rational self-interest, means to live in accordance with one's own rational interest, guided by reason and respecting the rights of others to life, liberty, and property.

### Should one practice altruism?

No. Altruism, in its essence, does not mean kindness, compassion, or help — but an ethical doctrine that claims that the moral virtue of an individual is measured by the degree to which he gives up his own interests, needs, and goals for the benefit of others.
